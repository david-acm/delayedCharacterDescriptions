## Features.

* Delayed descriptions: Announce the character description for the last read character after n milliseconds when the character was read by character review commands, E.G. left and right arrow keys, left, current or right character review commands, ETC.  
* Instant character descriptions: Read the character description instead of the current character. This feature must be enabled or disabled manually and will be deactivated when NVDA is closed.

## Notes.

* When instant character descriptions are enabled, delayed descriptions won't be announced.
* This add-on considers the auto language switching also. So if the last read character captured by this add-on was spoken in another language of your current default language, and auto language switching is on, the description will be read in the detected language.
* For delayed descriptions only: all characters that don't have a description available for the specified language (locale characterDescriptions.dic) will be ignored. E.G. if you read the character "4" and the current default or detected language is Spanish, you won't get a delayed description because Spanish  doesn't have a description for that symbol.
* For developers: In general, any character sent with textInfos.UNIT_CHARACTER argument to speech.speakTextInfo will activate a delayed character description.

## Requirements
  You need NVDA 2018.3 or later.

## Installation
  Just install it as a NVDA add-on.

## Usage
  The add-on functionality will be enabled once you install it.  
  To enable or disable it, go to NVDA settings and select "Enhanced phonetic reading". In that category you can set the following parameters:

* Enable delayed descriptions for characters.
* Delay to announce  character descriptions (in ms): the time the add-on waits to speak the description for the read character. You can't set it greater than 20000 ms.

## Scripts

* toggle instant character descriptions: Assigned to "nvda + control + numpad2" or "nvda+ control + enter" for laptop keyboards. This script enables or disables the instant character descriptions feature.
* toggle delayed descriptions: no gestures assigned. This script lets you toggle the delayed descriptions status.  

You can assign a command or gesture in speech category in the  NVDA input gestures dialog.

## Contributing to translation.

In order to make your work easier, I have left a 
[translation template in the master branch.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidacm/EnhancedPhoneticReading/master/EnhancedPhoneticReading.pot)
If you want to translate this add-on to another language and you don't want to open a github account or install python and other tools needed for the translation, do the following steps:

1. Use
[this template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidacm/EnhancedPhoneticReading/master/EnhancedPhoneticReading.pot),
as a base for the target language.
2. Download
["poedit"](https://poedit.net/),
this software will help you manage the translation strings.
3. If you want to translate the documentation too, you can use the
[English documentation at this link.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidacm/EnhancedPhoneticReading/master/readme.md)
4. Once you finished the translation, you can send me it to: "dhf360@gmail.com".

You won't need to compile the source files. I'll do it when releasing a new add-on version. I will mention your name in the respective commit. If you don't wish to be mentioned, let me in the e-mail.

Note: make sure you have used the latest translation strings template.

This is an alternative method. If you want, you always can go by the usual way. Fork this repo, update the translation for your language, and send me a PR. But this way just will add more complexity for you.
